                        We're here to sell you boba, not your data. We collect
                        only what's necessary to process your orders and make
                        your experience better.

                    <h3 class="font-heading text-2xl">1. WHAT WE COLLECT</h3>
                    <p>
                        Personal info (name, email, phone) only when you place
                        an order or contact us for catering. We use cookies to
                        remember your favorite tea mix so you don't have to
                        rebuild it every time.

                    <h3 class="font-heading text-2xl">2. HOW WE USE IT</h3>
                    <p>
                        To fulfill orders, respond to catering enquiries, and
                        occasionally send you secret drop alerts (only if you
                        subscribe). We never sell your info to third parties.
                        That's not our vibe.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="space-y-4">
                    <h3 class="font-heading text-2xl">3. THIRD PARTIES</h3>
                    <p>
                        We use trusted partners for payments (Stripe/Square) and
                        delivery (Uber Eats/DoorDash). They have their own
                        privacy policies which are just as serious as ours.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="space-y-4">
                    <h3 class="font-heading text-2xl">4. YOUR RIGHTS</h3>
                    <p>
                        You can ask us to delete your info anytime. Just pop an
                        email to yo@bobapop.com.au and we'll handle it.
